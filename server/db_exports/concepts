All of the definitions you've evaluated so far <b>come from some of the greatest experts on leadership</b>. Did you find yourself disagreeing with most of them?\n\nDon't worry if you did\, because <i>Kevin Kruse\, a highly regarded author of nine books\, including "Great Leaders Have No Rules"</i>\, has done the same. He challenged popular and widespread definitions of leadership and <b>discovered their flaws</b>.\n\nFor example\, the idea that a leader is someone who has followers comes from Peter Drucker\, a renowned management consultant known as the "father of modern management". But Kevin Kruse challenges this idea. He gives an example of a captain who commands 200 soldiers but never talks to them directly. Instead\, the captain gives orders through someone else\, and the soldiers <b>have to obey</b>. In this case\, <i>is the captain really a leader</i>?\n\nWhat about the next idea\, "Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality"? This thought comes from Warren Bennis\, a respected expert on leadership and organisational behaviour. Once more\, Kevin Kruse brings up an important point by highlighting <b>the absence of "others"</b>. Let's say every spring you have a vision for a garden\, and through your hard work\, you successfully grow carrots and tomatoes. In this case\, can you be considered a leader? <i>Is it possible to be a leader if you are working alone\, like a team of one?</i>\n\nBill Gates\, who played a major role in building Microsoft into a technology giant\, defines leaders as those who empower others. Yet\, Kevin Kruse questions this definition due to the <b>lack of a shared goal or vision</b>. He asks <i>if someone can truly be a leader if they only offer freedom without clear expectations and accountability?</i>\n\nThe last two statements come from John Maxwell\, a well-known author and speaker on leadership\, and Dwight D. Eisenhower\, a significant figure in American history\, known for his military leadership and presidency. <i>Is leadership only about influence and our ability to manipulate others?</i> Kevin Kruse questions if this definition is comprehensive enough. To illustrate his point\, he poses a scenario: <b>What about <b>a robber who holds a gun and exerts influence over their victim</b>?</b> <i>Does this influence (incl. manipulation) automatically make the robber a leader?</i>\n\nExpanding upon widely accepted literary definitions\, Kevin Kruse proposes that: "Leadership is a process of social influence\, which maximises the efforts of others towards the achievement of a goal". This fresh definition comprises several crucial elements.\n\nFirstly\, leadership <b>emerges from social influence</b>\, <i>not just from authority or power</i>. It involves engaging and inspiring others\, who may not necessarily be direct reports. There is no mention of specific personality traits\, attributes\, or titles associated with leadership.\n\nFurthermore\, this definition emphasises <b>the inclusion of a goal</b>. It recognizes that leadership <i>is not just about influencing others without any intended outcome</i>. \n\nLastly\, what sets this definition apart from many academic definitions is the mention of <b>"maximising the efforts" of others</b>. This highlights <i>the importance of optimising and harnessing the collective contributions of those being led</i>.\n\nWhen you think about what defines a leader\, remember Kevin Kruse's view. He sees a leader as <b>visionary\, an influencer\, and a catalyst for others' efforts</b>.\n,\N,8a7cae95-d19e-4d43-84aa-7ca0f31e9095
