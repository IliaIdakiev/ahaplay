All of the definitions you've evaluated so far <b>come from some of the greatest experts on leadership</b>. Did you find yourself disagreeing with some of them?</p><p>Don't worry if you did\, because <i>Kevin Kruse\, a highly regarded author of nine books\, including "Great Leaders Have No Rules"</i>\, has done the same. He challenged popular and widespread definitions of leadership and <b>discovered their flaws</b>.</p><p>For example\, the idea that a leader is someone who has followers comes from Peter Drucker\, a renowned management consultant known as the "father of modern management". But Kevin Kruse challenges this idea. He gives an example of a captain who commands 200 soldiers but never talks to them directly. Instead\, the captain gives orders through someone else\, and the soldiers <b>have to obey</b>. In this case\, <i>is the captain really a leader</i>?</p><p>What about the next idea\, "Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality"? This thought comes from Warren Bennis\, a respected expert on leadership and organisational behaviour. Once more\, Kevin Kruse brings up an important point by highlighting <b>the absence of "others"</b>. Let's say every spring you have a vision for a garden\, and through your hard work\, you successfully grow carrots and tomatoes. In this case\, can you be considered a leader? <i>Is it possible to be a leader if you are working alone\, like a team of one?</i></p><p>Bill Gates\, who played a major role in building Microsoft into a technology giant\, defines leaders as those who empower others. Yet\, Kevin Kruse questions this definition due to the <b>lack of a shared goal or vision</b>. He asks <i>if someone can truly be a leader if they only offer freedom without clear expectations and accountability?</i></p><p>The last two statements come from John Maxwell\, a well-known author and speaker on leadership\, and Dwight D. Eisenhower\, a significant figure in American history\, known for his military leadership and presidency. <i>Is leadership only about influence and our ability to manipulate others?</i> Kevin Kruse questions if this definition is comprehensive enough. To illustrate his point\, he poses a scenario: <b>What about <b>a robber who holds a gun and exerts influence over their victim</b>?</b> <i>Does this influence (incl. manipulation) automatically make the robber a leader?</i></p><p>Expanding upon widely accepted literary definitions\, Kevin Kruse proposes that: "Leadership is a process of social influence\, which maximises the efforts of others towards the achievement of a goal". This fresh definition comprises several crucial elements.</p><p>Firstly\, leadership <b>emerges from social influence</b>\, <i>not just from authority or power</i>. It involves engaging and inspiring others\, who may not necessarily be direct reports. There is no mention of specific personality traits\, attributes\, or titles associated with leadership.</p><p>Furthermore\, this definition emphasises <b>the inclusion of a goal</b>. It recognizes that leadership <i>is not just about influencing others without any intended outcome</i>.</p><p>Lastly\, what sets this definition apart from many academic definitions is the mention of <b>"maximising the efforts" of others</b>. This highlights <i>the importance of optimising and harnessing the collective contributions of those being led</i>.</p><p>When you think about what defines a leader\, remember Kevin Kruse's universal criteria. He sees a leader as <b>visionary\, an influencer\, and a catalyst for others' efforts</b>.</p>,\N,0e867ed7-79ae-4ac4-b5ad-c315536cf184

A few years ago\, <i>I would've confidently answered them</i>\, believing that <i>a group becomes a team once they share a common goal</i>. Do you think the same?<p><p>Imagine my surprise when an individual I deeply respected challenged me. He asserted it wasn't true and let me figure out the reasons why. After months of research\, I found a definition that seemed complete. I told him about it\, and he was surprised too! He believed that besides having a shared goal\, <i>team members should depend on each other to truly form a team</i>. And he was right\, but there was more depth to it. I still remember laughing at ourselves.</p><p>I came across a definition by Kozlowski and Bell. According to them\, certain characteristics must be present for a group of people to qualify as a team. I will highlight the most important ones.</p><p>The first characteristic is that <b>team members share one or more common goals</b>. Based on this\, many of the given examples could be seen as teams. The football fans aim to create a Mexican Wave\, the colleagues intend to help start a car\, and you\, as workshop participants\, aim to achieve a successful workshop outcome together.</p><p>The second characteristic is <b>team members to interact socially</b>\, meaning teams involve interpersonal dynamics. Members <i>communicate\, collaborate\, and interact with each other</i>. With this characteristic in mind\, the technical support specialists\, each handling different customer accounts\, and the scientists\, each authoring separate chapters of the scientific report\, might not align with this notion of a team.</p><p>The third characteristic is to <b>exhibit task interdependencies\, highlighting that the efforts of one member can affect the outcomes of others</b>. Take the technical support specialists as an example. While they each handle separate customer accounts and work mostly in isolation\, they share common success metrics. This means the team's overall success is interdependent. However\, the tasks they perform are likely independent\, without relying on the work of another specialist who manages a different account.</p><p>The fourth characteristic is <b>maintaining and managing boundaries</b>\, meaning that the team needs to be distinguishable from other groups and should have a clear sense of who is a member and who isn’t. The examples of a stadium audience creating a Mexican wave or colleagues spontaneously assisting to start a car might not quite fit with that definition of a team. They either lack clear boundaries\, or if present\, the boundaries are significantly blurred.</p><p>Another key aspect of Kozlowski and Bell's definition emphasises that <i>teams aren't isolated entities</i>. They're shaped by the broader organisational framework\, its rules\, and interactions with other departments. Additionally\, teams are established with the intent of accomplishing tasks vital to the organisation.</p><p>When you find yourself wondering if you and your colleagues form a team\, consider the following: Do you <b>share a common goal and rely on each other in tasks</b>? <b>How often do you socialise during work</b>\, and <b>are there clear boundaries understood by all</b>? If these elements are present\, <i>you're likely functioning as a team</i>.</p>,\N,fb5b3670-f3b9-4119-bd73-4a3f2c20a47f

The first is through a <b>respectful engagement</b>\, which means <i>interacting with someone so that you convey a sense of the person’s worth and value</i>.</p><p>By treating others with respect\, you initiate a positive energy loop of good emotions that elevates the happiness and productivity of all those involved. Dutton provides five strategies for respectful engagement: being present\, conveying affirmation\, being genuine\, applying active listening\, and being supportive in communication. <b>To be present</b>\, one should <i>avoid distractions and use appropriate body language\, and be available</i>. To <b>convey affirmation</b>\, <i>one should look for the value in others\, recognize their efforts\, express genuine interest\, and be on time</i>. Being genuine is important in respectful engagement. Active listening is also crucial. Being supportive in communication involves <i>using requests instead of demands\, expressing thoughts clearly\, and avoiding evaluative statements</i>.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of exhibiting behavior that demonstrates respectful engagement:\n<ul>\n<li>Using the “raise hand” feature or <b>waiting for an appropriate time to speak</b> during a virtual meeting.</li>\n<li>Avoiding multitasking during a virtual meeting and <b>giving your full attention to the discussion</b>.</li>\n<li><b>Showing empathy and understanding</b> when a colleague is experiencing technical difficulties during a virtual meeting.</li>\n<li>Sharing the virtual meeting agenda or goals ahead of time <b>to allow colleagues to come prepared</b>.</li>\n<li><b>Thanking</b> colleagues for their contributions and participation in virtual meetings.</li>\n</ul></p>,\N,67f58e1b-7858-4863-ab05-f4528694ff0d

I used to believe that <b>any form of tension in interactions</b>\, whether it be <i>mental tension from differing opinions\, emotional tension from feeling offended\, or physical tension from feeling threatened</i>\, <b>indicated a conflict</b>. What's your perspective on this? Do you think the same?</p><p>A few years ago\, I was asked to coach a team that was struggling and had a lot of tension. Just after a couple of days\, I noticed something wasn't right. Most of the tension was because of disagreements that weren't really stopping anyone from moving forward. It was more like arguing just for the sake of it. Also\, they were discussing everything all the time. I suggested they first see if they really disagreed before starting a discussion. They were surprised to find out that most of the time\, they actually agreed with each other. That was the moment <i>I questioned whether tension and conflict are truly related\, or if my understanding of conflict\, like many others'\, might be mistaken</i>.</p><p>After diving into extensive research\, I found my own answer. It revealed that <i>tension in interactions doesn't always indicate a conflict</i>. Even more surprising was learning that <i>conflicts can exist without any apparent tension</i>. How could this be?</p><p>I realised that conflict relies on two key elements. The first is a <b>difference between the parties</b>\, which may include differences in values\, needs\, beliefs\, and other aspects. The second is a <b>dependency</b>\, where the parties need each other and can't move forward without one another. Therefore\, the simple definition of conflict I adopted is: <i>any situation where there's both a difference\, in any form\, and a dependency between the involved parties</i>.</p><p>According to this definition\, situations like the two programmers discussing naming conventions\, colleagues arguing about technology\, and your disagreement with the stranger on the stairs don't count as conflicts. They're missing either a significant difference or a dependency. However\, the team member voicing concerns about a new technique in her team and needing to agree as part of this workshop\, even with different views\, are real conflicts. They might not have escalated and become harmful\, but they meet the criteria of both difference and dependency.</p><p>Now\, when you find yourself in an argument\, pause to ask: Does this truly matter? <b>Is there a significant difference? Is there a dependency?</b> If either element is absent\, <i>consider stepping back to maintain your efficiency\, or continue if you enjoy the debate</i>.</p>,\N,e14894cf-a859-4601-aba0-3ad6a6c00282
