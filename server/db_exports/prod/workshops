You also built and managed the entire software platform.<p>\n<p>This often occurs in my training. A recurring question from participants is “How can you wear so many hats? Be a scientist\, trainer\, designer\, programmer\, and more?” The answer is simple: I've cultivated T-shaped skills. <i>While I have deep expertise in one area\, I also possess a broad knowledge in various others</i>. <b>It's not about being magical\, but about continuous learning</b>. This approach has granted me <i>immense flexibility\, freedom\, and opportunities in what I do</i>.</p>\n<p>Bradley Staats' book “Never Stop Learning” highlights the significance of <b>the learning economy</b>. In this fast-evolving world\, he stresses <i>the need to be dynamic learners to stay ahead</i>. What stood out to me were the four principles of dynamic learning\, termed the 4Fs: <b>focused\, fast\, frequent\, and flexible</b>. It's a perspective that truly resonated with my own experience.</p>\n<p>In this workshop\, <b>we'll dive into the four principles of dynamic learning and see how today's top learning methods can nurture them</b>.

To empower us <i>to shape our future\, whether that's making a software training platform like I did\, or tackling even bigger challenges</i>.</p>,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/5b8359a4-df55-423e-827c-b3bab0bebe00

In Agile settings\, an additional 9% seek Scrum training. For non-Agile teams\, Change Management takes precedence\, often due to resistance to change or comfort zone entrenchment\, which impedes ongoing improvement and peak performance. This trend raises a critical question: Is there an underlying issue with our corporate training approaches if <b>such a narrow range of topics consistently dominates demand</b>? <i>Are we missing key areas of development that could further enhance team dynamics and performance</i>?</p>\n<p>Truthfully\, this trend isn't surprising. Pinpointing the fundamental developmental needs of a team is complex. <i>Issues like miscommunication\, rising conflicts\, ineffective processes\, and resistance to change are merely symptoms</i>. So\, <b>what lies at the heart of these problems</b>? Just as a doctor requires a thorough grasp of the human body to decipher its symptoms\, understanding team dynamics is vital to identifying the core team challenges. One pivotal element of these dynamics is the current developmental stage of the team.</p>\n<p>A multitude of theories <i>explore the evolution of teams as time progresses</i>. <b>Bruce Tuckman's five-stage model</b>\, rooted in his expertise as a psychological researcher\, is particularly insightful. <i>While each stage has its inherent challenges\, proven strategies can assist teams in navigating these obstacles and achieving excellence</i>.</p>\n<p>While the Tuckman model charts a clear path\, the journey for many teams isn't always straight. They might bypass phases\, stay in one longer\, or even double back. <b>It's crucial to frequently gauge where your team is and respond to evolving needs</b>.

The information provided is limited and represents the viewpoint of a single department you're collaborating with. As you read\, you concentrate on specific phrases that seem to confirm your suspicions that your most recent release wasn't particularly successful. You interpret these particular statements as an indication of the sender's frustration\, which shapes your understanding of their intentions and the context of the email. You surmise that the sender is displeased and seeking recompense for lost opportunities. Prepared for such an event\, you promptly send an email containing a detailed proposal. You feel a sense of relief\, confident that your foresight has once again proven that any problem can be resolved through appropriate negotiations and compensation.\nHowever\, a few days later\, you discover that your proposal has upset the client. Their response is clear: "We don't want compensation; we want a reliable and trustworthy partner." You smile to yourself\, thinking that perhaps the compensation offered simply wasn't sufficient.\nThis example <i>demonstrates the cognitive stages we go through when moving from raw data to conclusions</i>. These conclusions <i>further reinforce our beliefs\, influencing future actions and perpetuating self-reinforcing loops and biases</i>.

However\, it's not uncommon for <b>groups to find themselves at an impasse</b>. As a result\, <i>some participants become disengaged and unmotivated</i>\, choosing to <i>withdraw from the conversation and leaving decision-making to others</i>. On the other hand\, certain individuals exhibit <i>impatience and intolerance</i>\, attempting to <i>impose their proposals on the rest of the group</i>. Prolonged indecision can also lead to <i>increased irritability\, heightened anxiety\, and the emergence of passive-aggressive behaviors among group members</i>. These factors can significantly hinder the decision-making process and negatively impact the outcomes. Especially when it comes to remote teams.\nCan we <b>overcome decision-making impasses and boost efficiency in virtual settings</b>? How can we <b>speed up digital decision-making</b>?\nIn my experience facilitating virtual workshops over the past few years\, <i>several key elements have proven invaluable in ensuring success</i>. These include: 1) <b>recognizing the unique stages of group decision-making</b>; 2) <b>effectively communicating the current stage and its desired outcome</b> to the group; and 3) <b>employing appropriate facilitation techniques for each stage</b> to maximize time efficiency. My approach to achieving these goals is grounded in <b>the Diamond of Participation</b>\, a model developed by Sam Kaner\, Lenny Lind\, Catherine Toldi\, Sarah Fisk\, and Duane Berger\, and elaborated in their book\, "Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making."\nIn this workshop\, <i>we'll connect widely-used virtual facilitation techniques to the Diamond of Participation</i>\, aiming to <b>enhance our approach to decision-making in virtual environments</b>.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/4b03a8f5-33a1-4ed2-95c1-0db9cfd74ffe

Can you imagine the number of definitions that are available? 10? 100? <i>I can bet my head that there are even more!</i>\nYou might wonder\, why does this matter?\nLet me tell you a story that happens to me quite often. Imagine you аre in a meeting with the leadership team of a company. They need to make a quick but still important decision. However\, something goes wrong. The talk gradually changes to leadership and what's expected from real leaders in the situation. But since they can not agree on this\, they start arguing\, and the initial process of making a decision gets stuck. The tension builds up\, and eventually\, they decide to move to another topic on the meeting agenda. Surprisingly\, what should have been a decision made in just 15 minutes ends up taking days or even weeks. Can you guess what could be the reason for this?\nJust like people rowing a boat in different ways\, leaders can end up arguing about what they should do. The tricky part is that <i>all definitions of leadership might be correct\, and the exact definition does not matter too much</i>. The real problem is <b>the lack of shared agreement on what leadership really is</b>. And just like with the rowing boat situation\, it is not just the lack of progress that this might cause – <i>relationships can weaken\, which makes things even less effective over time</i>.\nSo\, the first important step in any leadership journey\, especially when working with other leaders\, is <b>to make sure everyone agrees on what it means to be a leader</b>.\n,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/c485617d-a4d8-4593-a71c-9afa8b341d4b

He discovered that when animals were exposed to situations where stress was uncontrollable and escape was impossible\, they eventually became passive. Even when conditions changed and they could escape\, <i>they didn't try</i>. He named this behavior learned helplessness. Later\, the idea was applied to humans\, suggesting that <i>after facing uncontrollable challenges\, people might act in ways similar to those with clinical depression</i>.</p>\n<p>In response to learned helplessness\, Seligman introduced learned optimism. He believed that while some people naturally think in ways that lead to helplessness\, <i>others can train themselves to be more optimistic</i>. Importantly\, he argued that <b>optimism is a skill that can be learned</b>.</p>\n<p>In his research on learned optimism\, Seligman introduced the 3Ps resilience model which highlights <i>three emotional responses to adversity</i>: <b>personalization\, pervasiveness\, and permanence</b>.

To achieve this\, we employ a stick to maintain its proper alignment. This way\, the sapling gradually grows straight and strong\, reaching its full potential. However\, in the absence of such support\, the tree bows and grows into an unintended direction. <i>Rectifying this error later on entails exerting significant force\, likely resulting in either the tree's breakage or the destruction of its surroundings</i>.\nSimilarly\, in a corporate setting\, <b>employees benefit from continuous\, low-impact feedback that helps them develop their skills and maintain a strong performance trajectory</b>. This consistent guidance is like the supporting stick for the tree\, <i>enabling employees to make gradual adjustments and adapt to changing situations</i>.

Is it because some people just don't know how to communicate\, or is it that we ourselves struggle with effective communication?\nThe truth is\, <i>it's perfectly normal for communication to vary</i> because people have different communication styles\, and <i>challenges arise when there's a mismatch between these styles</i>. In the 1920s\, psychologist Dr. William Marston developed one of the most popular models <i>to help individuals understand their own communication and behavioral tendencies\, as well as those of others</i> - <b>the DISC model</b>. This model categorizes four primary communication styles: Dominance\, Influence\, Steadiness\, and Compliance\, using two dimensions.\nThe first dimension\, <b>Task vs. People Orientation</b>\, differentiates between those <i>more focused on tasks\, goals\, and results</i> (<b>Task Orientation</b>)\, and those <i>more focused on building relationships and nurturing social connections</i> (<b>People Orientation</b>). Dominance (D) and Compliance (C) lean towards task orientation\, while Influence (I) and Steadiness (S) are more people-oriented.\nThe second dimension\, <b>Active vs. Passive Orientation</b>\, distinguishes between individuals who are <i>proactive\, assertive\, and expressive</i> (<b>Active Orientation</b>) and those who are <i>patient\, reflective\, and reserved</i> (<b>Passive Orientation</b>). Dominance (D) and Influence (I) are more active-oriented\, while Steadiness (S) and Compliance (C) are more passive-oriented.  \nIn this workshop\, we'll delve into the DISC model and explore <i>how to tailor our communication styles and interactions to promote more effective collaboration\, while minimizing potential misunderstandings or conflicts</i>.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/35551b4c-71a4-4512-bb98-507868e77a66

I needed an electric kettle. But it had to be a specific one - it had to brew the sencha at around 70-80 degrees celsius. So I went to the local electronics store. I approached one of the store associates and asked her for help. She was very respectful\, she listened to me very carefully\, she showed me all available models and consulted me patiently and thoroughly. I really felt cared for. However there was no model that I really liked. Either they had no temperature control\, or the brand was unknown\, or the kettle itself was just “ugly”. So 30 minutes later there was no model I wanted to buy. However I couldn’t leave the store empty handed. The girl was so kind to me\, spending more than half an hour consulting me. How could I do this? So I just bought one of the models. The moment I left the store I felt really bad. This wasn’t my kettle and I didn’t want it. But something “invisible” forced me to buy it.\nAre there <i>hidden forces that shape our behavior</i>? And <i>influence our decisions</i>? According to the social psychologist Robert Cialdini there are <b>six universal principles of persuasion</b> that work no matter the cultural context. <i>And they are so strong that when we’re making decisions on an autopilot</i> - there’s a <b>big chance to be gamed by these hidden forces</b>.\nDon't let hidden forces manipulate your decisions\, just as they did in my case! <i>You have the power to take control of your choices and shape your own destiny</i>.

It worked for some people\, but not for most. Sometimes\, it just <i>didn't motivate</i> them\, and sometimes\, it even <i>made them more resistant</i>.\nLater on\, as I gained more experience leading organizational transformations\, I realized that my way of explaining changes was all wrong. <i>I thought that if something would inspire me\, it would work for everyone else too</i>. But I discovered the hard way <b>that people might see the change in a very different perspective than I do</b>. I had to step back from my own reasons and <i>seek out the rationales of others</i>.\nThat's when I learned about the <i>three needs theory from David McClelland</i>\, a famous psychologist from America. It was simpler than other theories\, and it fit well with managing change. According to McClelland\, there are three needs that drive us at work: <b>achievement\, affiliation\, and power</b>. Each of us has a mix of these needs\, with one being most important at a time.\nIn a short time\, I quickly realized that it could work wonders in aiding people to accept change by simply <b>discussing it in a manner that aligns with their primary need</b>. For instance\, if someone is resistant to change\, they likely feel that their main need is at risk\, and you must assure them that it will be safeguarded. If motivation is lacking\, probably the change doesn't seem appealing to them as it doesn't connect with their primary need. Regardless of the situation\, <b>discussing change in terms of their needs is more effective than focusing on your own</b>. At least\, this was true in my experience.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/2acadf81-7450-4603-8e69-cd0e28b787b9

This united front allowed them to keep watch over the entire field\, ensuring the lion couldn't approach without being seen. <i>Through trust and unwavering unity\, they remained safe from the lion's attacks.</i>\nYet\, as time went on\, differences began to sow discord among the oxen\, leading them to separate and graze apart. <i>With their bond of trust shattered</i>\, they could no longer protect one another from the lion\, which then preyed upon them individually\, exploiting their isolation and vulnerability.\nThe fable's moral is clear: <b>to break a team\, destroy trust among its members; to make a team thrive\, foster trust between them</b>. <i>This age-old tale encapsulates the profound power of trust in teamwork\, gleaned from millennia of human experience</i>.\nToday\, we have access to numerous frameworks that guide us in building trust within teams. In this workshop\, we will delve into the <b>ABCDs of Trust</b>\, developed by leadership expert Ken Blanchard. This model <i>identifies four essential components that work in tandem to forge a solid foundation of trust: Able\, Believable\, Connected\, and Dependable</i>.

She was quickly swallowed into an abyss of mistrust\, where vulnerabilities were hidden and weaknesses veiled. Conflicts were avoided like a plague\, leading to a lack of commitment to decisions and a pervasive evasion of accountability. The team's attention was disturbingly divorced from collective results\, a symptom of the underlying dysfunctions. The daunting enormity of Kathryn's task to transform this team was becoming starkly apparent.\nThis marks the beginning of Patrick Lencioni’s insightful business fable\, eloquently illustrating <i>the common pitfalls that teams face as they seek to grow together</i>. Through the struggles of Kathryn\, the newly-appointed CEO of a technology firm\, we are introduced to <i>the five dysfunctions</i> that can cripple teams: <b>absence of trust\, fear of conflict\, lack of commitment\, avoidance of accountability\, and inattention to results</b>.\nIn this workshop <i>we'll explore each of these dysfunctions in detail\, and more importantly\, how to overcome them</i> to <b>create a cohesive\, high-performing team</b>.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/c156c8e1-6131-44ef-8d7e-31d5f230cf97

What do you think? Is this true?\nI wonder what Dr. Carol Dweck's response would be. As a distinguished psychologist from Stanford University\, she has been at the forefront of research on <b>fixed and growth mindsets</b>\, illustrating <i>their profound influence on our motivation\, effort\, resilience\, and exceptional performance</i>.\nAccording to Dweck a <b>growth mindset is the belief that our abilities are not fixed but can be developed through effort\, training\, and perseverance</b>. People with this mindset see challenges as opportunities for growth\, view effort as a means to achieve mastery\, regard criticism as constructive feedback\, and are inspired by the success of others\, seeing it as a valuable learning opportunity.\nOn the opposite side is the <b>fixed mindset which is rooted in the belief that our abilities are unchangeable traits</b>. Individuals with this mindset often avoid challenges to prevent failure or appearing unintelligent\, see effort as useless if they don't naturally excel\, interpret criticism as personal attacks\, and may feel threatened or envious when confronted with the success of others.\nSir Edmund Hillary exemplifies the essence of a growth mindset. And indeed\, <b>he's correct that our thought patterns can sometimes become our own worst enemy</b>.

Imagine that you've become a seasoned conflict navigator\, adept at resolving disputes at work\, in your personal life\, and even during your routine grocery store visits. You've mastered the art of de-escalating conflicts and making peace among your neighbors. With time and experience\, you've acquired the wisdom to create a go-to approach for resolving these everyday battles. But then\, <i>you're faced with a new challenge\, and suddenly\, your trusted method fails</i>. Is it merely bad luck or something else?\nThe truth is that it's not bad luck but rather <b>the "one-size-fits-all" trap in conflict resolution</b>. <i>Conflicts are as diverse as the people and situations that create them\, and applying the same approach to every disagreement is bound to yield mixed results</i>.\nTo truly understand and resolve a conflict\, <b>one must dive beneath the surface and explore the underlying causes</b>. <i>By identifying the root of the issue\, you'll be well on your way to resolving the conflict in a sustainable and effective manner</i>.\nPsychologists Art Bell and Brett Hart have uncovered eight common causes of conflict in the workplace. Gaining awareness of these causes can empower you to pinpoint the root of a conflict\, tailor your resolution strategy to fit the situation\, and take proactive steps to prevent future conflicts from arising.

A few years later\, I also began researching organizational agile transformations as a scientist. Fast-forward nearly two decades\, and after countless hours of training\, consulting\, and coaching\, <i>one recurring theme continues to surface regarding the failure of many teams and organizations with Scrum</i>: <b>cultural clashes</b>.\nAgile\, and Scrum in particular\, are founded on a predefined set of values that must be embraced by both teams and organizations to ensure success. More often than not\, <i>these values are absent\, leading to a multitude of challenges and hindrances in the effective adoption of Scrum</i>. As culture can be difficult to change\, resolving the tension created by these cultural clashes may require more time and effort than many teams and organizations are willing to invest. This leads <i>to a commonly encountered dilemma in practice</i>: <b>should we "adapt" (or more accurately\, "cherry-pick") Scrum to fit our unique cultural context?</b> Most of the time\, the answer is <b>"let's do it!"</b>\nHowever\, Scrum works because <i>its components are meticulously designed and interconnected\, forming a "mechanism" or\, more appropriately\, a "system" that delivers its benefits</i>. For this reason\, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland emphasize that <b>Scrum is immutable</b> - <i>no changes to the framework are permitted</i>. Furthermore\, each of the components and the system as a whole\, though rooted in empirical process control theory\, are <i>substantially reinforced by the five Scrum values</i>. <b>Without these values\, the structure collapses\, taking with it all the benefits of Scrum</b>.\nIn this workshop\, we will <b>explore the five Scrum values</b> and\, more importantly\, examine <b>how they are integrated into the various Scrum rules</b>. This deeper understanding <i>will enhance our awareness of the system's inner workings and further clarify why adaptations to the Scrum framework are not permitted</i>.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/53887b65-060b-45dd-8036-b376d6b58995

If so\, you know <b>how challenging it can be to have a productive and inclusive discussion</b>. Meetings are essential for collaborating\, sharing ideas\, making decisions\, and solving problems but they <i>can also be a source of frustration and unproductive behavior</i>. \nAs a seasoned workshop facilitator\, I've learned that <i>there are at least two strategies that are essential to successful meetings</i>: setting clear expectations and guidelines\, and understanding the impact of behavior on meeting dynamics.\nThe first thing I always do when working with groups is <b>to establish and agree on a set of behavior ground rules</b>. This easy-to-implement step can <i>significantly improve the meeting experience\, creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable and engaged</i>\n<i>However\, even with clear rules\, challenging behaviors can still arise</i>. That's where <b>understanding Benne and Sheats' 8 dysfunctional roles</b> comes in - this knowledge <i>helps me quickly spot behaviors that may be disruptive or unproductive\, and take appropriate action</i>.\nBy combining these two powerful strategies\, we can <b>create a meeting culture that is both productive and inclusive</b>.

I would jump into each dispute\, putting in a lot of time and effort. Although I won many\, looking back now\, I see that these "fights" were not really necessary. If I could talk to my younger self\, I would say <b>"All that glitters is not gold"</b> and <i>to be more careful in choosing which battles to get involved in</i>.\nNow\, in my middle years\, my energy isn't as high\, so I've become very picky about what I get involved in. But this has its own problem. Sometimes\, by just ignoring a disagreement\, it turns into an <b>unhealthy conflict</b>. And <i>if I don't pay attention to it\, it escalates and starts to hurt my relationships with others</i>.\n<b>But how to know which disputes are worth it?</b> When to step back or step up and try to solve the problem? After a lot of research\, I've learned what it really means to have a conflict. I understand that it's always happening\, but many conflicts are actually okay so we don't really notice them. Others get worse and start to make our lives and work difficult. On the other hand\, a lot of what we think are conflicts aren't really\, but we still waste our energy trying to "solve" them.\nIn this workshop\, we'll look <b>at what makes a conflict</b>. We'll try to understand it together\, so we can spot them quickly. This will <i>help us stay away from the ones that don't matter but be ready to deal with the disagreements that are really important</i>.,https://share.synthesia.io/embeds/videos/b0eab545-3d46-43f5-9fce-9ec048fe9ddd
