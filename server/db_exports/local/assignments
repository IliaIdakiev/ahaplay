10,In this workshop\, you will get to create your own definition of leadership.\nBefore that\, you'll need to review different statements that describe leadership. This will help you clarify your inner\, often unconscious\, understanding on the matter. We strongly suggest making notes about your thoughts\, reflections\, ideas\, and anything else related to these statements\, as they will facilitate crafting your own definition later on.\nFor example\, you might come across a statement like "A leader is a dealer in hope". You'll then need to determine whether you agree with this definition or find it wrong\, incomplete\, outdated\, or if there's something else that does not sit right with you.\nBy the end of the workshop\, you will be invited to compare your own leadership definition with the author's choice. This will further validate your current understanding and will help you craft a shared definition of leadership.\n,https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpjP6F89lMk,81cae840-d6ff-4e50-88ac-1cb40ab1e580,bd4e1914-bc20-4237-bb81-b5eeb887ed23
