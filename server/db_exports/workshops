Can you imagine the number of definitions that are available? 10? 100? <i>I can bet my head that there are even more!</i>\nYou might wonder\, why does this matter?\nLet me tell you a story that happens to me quite often. Imagine you аre in a meeting with the leadership team of a company. They need to make a quick but still important decision. However\, something goes wrong. The talk gradually changes to leadership and what's expected from real leaders in the situation. But since they can not agree on this\, they start arguing\, and the initial process of making a decision gets stuck. The tension builds up\, and eventually\, they decide to move to another topic on the meeting agenda. Surprisingly\, what should have been a decision made in just 15 minutes ends up taking days or even weeks. Can you guess what could be the reason for this?\nJust like people rowing a boat in different ways\, leaders can end up arguing about what they should do. The tricky part is that <i>all definitions of leadership might be correct\, and the exact definition does not matter too much</i>. The real problem is <b>the lack of shared agreement on what leadership really is</b>. And just like with the rowing boat situation\, it is not just the lack of progress that this might cause – <i>relationships can weaken\, which makes things even less effective over time</i>.\nSo\, the first important step in any leadership journey\, especially when working with other leaders\, is <b>to make sure everyone agrees on what it means to be a leader</b>.\n,https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpjP6F89lMk
